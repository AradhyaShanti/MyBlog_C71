    <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I
    got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time
    when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure
    any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will
    participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always
    pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then
    It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and
    they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 ">The food option and responsiblities to consider,
      canteens must be better organised and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the 
      meals  prepared, and detailed description of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional
      choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the 
      school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirments they may have. Odering Online
       by ticking a box and playing for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less
       complicated for staff and student alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12 ">Implement Online Attendance Management System: This 
      informs parents about there child's/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the 
    parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps school keep a record of the student' absenteeism.
    Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin.
    The tracker has so much potential that it can identify with students are irregular to their classes and not ready to 
    establish connectivity with the actual cocepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment
    Number or name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxie are
    possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that
    those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after the admin enters login details into 
    this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their
    parents are pre-informed about the real time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at
    reduced costs. </p>
